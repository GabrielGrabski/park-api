# üèûÔ∏è Welcome to Park API!

## ‚ùì What is this project?

The **Pawnee Parks & Recreation Department** is building a new internal tool to help **Leslie Knope** and her team
manage relationships with vendors, community members, and local businesses.

You‚Äôve been asked to create the foundation for a **Customer Service API** to help the department track the people they
work with and eventually provide helpful, automated insights.

## üöÄ How to run?

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Build Docker image

```bash
docker build -t park-api .
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the container

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 park-api
```

Now your API should be up and running! ‚úÖ

## Trade-offs

### Swagger:

* For better separation of responsibilities, we can leave Swagger in a separate project where we write the YAML. The
  downside would be more work to document our APIs, as it will have to be written manually and there's potential for
  human error.

### Security

* To increase security, we could add JWT login to ensure our API is stateless. We could also add roles to make our API
  even more secure, ensuring that each user has the appropriate access and cannot access inappropriate resources (such
  as a guest user not being able to deactivate another user).

### Architecture

* Because it's a very small project, I preferred to use a layered architecture, dividing resources into controllers,
  services, and repositories. However, there's still room for refactoring to add other architectural types; this would
  depend largely on the project's scope.

### Caching

* As the amount of data in our database grows, we can add a caching layer, where our data would be retrieved more
  quickly.

### Database

* I'm using an in-memory database (H2). However, the correct approach for a real application would be to use a
  relational database (such as PostgreSQL) or a non-relational database, depending on the need.

### Insights feature

* To be honest, I tried to implement the insights feature using Hugging Face AI, but I realized that it would take to
  long, and then I decided to do not implement the functionality
